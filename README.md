The client was CTS Creative Technology Solutions. The software they wanted designed was for a web based game named Draw it or Lose it. I think I did well in reviewing the development tools for various platforms. I think I would revise my recommendations while there is not anything inherently bad about them I think they could be more fleshed out. I tried to ensure all the users needs were met through the process. It is important to consider the users needs because you are doing a job for them and if it is not to their liking then there will likely not be return business.
